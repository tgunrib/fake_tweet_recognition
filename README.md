# Fake Tweet Recognition
This is a project about finding fake tweet given dataset of different topics. To do this:
- The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed and features - https://github.com/tgunrib/fake_tweet_recognition/blob/main/Pre-processing.ipynb
- Analysed using Exploratory Data Analysis - https://github.com/tgunrib/fake_tweet_recognition/blob/main/Data%20Analysis.ipynb
- Models were given the dataset and compared based on the their recall score - https://github.com/tgunrib/fake_tweet_recognition/blob/main/data_model.ipynb

This project was successful where it showed that by cleaning and preprocessing, the model was able to acheive a high f1 irrespective of the unequal distribution in the dataset where the f1_score was 0.98 on average.
